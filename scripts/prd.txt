## Final Production Goals

### App Store Preparation & Deployment
- Final performance optimization and bundle size reduction
- App store assets creation (screenshots, videos, descriptions)
- **Cannabis Compliance & App Store Review Strategy:**
  * **Platform-Specific Policy Research:**
    - Apple App Store: Review Developer Program License Agreement Section 1.4.3 and App Review Guidelines 1.4.3
    - Google Play: Analyze Developer Policy Center restrictions on illegal activities and regulated goods
    - Document specific prohibited content categories and gray areas for each platform
  * **Geographic Content Strategy:**
    - Map legal cannabis jurisdictions vs. app availability regions
    - Implement geolocation-based content filtering and disclaimers
    - Plan phased rollout starting with most permissive jurisdictions (Canada, certain US states)
    - Develop region-specific app store descriptions and marketing materials
  * **Content Classification & Age Verification:**
    - Implement robust 18+/21+ age verification system before app access
    - Apply for appropriate content ratings (17+ iOS, Mature 17+ Android)
    - Separate educational content from any cultivation guidance
    - Remove or modify any content that could be interpreted as facilitating illegal drug use
  * **Educational vs. Commercial Content Distinction:**
    - Frame all content as educational/informational only
