## 🎯 **ANIMATION PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Form Animations**
```typescript
// Step transitions with smooth slide effects
const stepTransition = useSharedValue(0);
const stepAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ translateX: withSpring(stepTransition.value * 300) }],
}));

// Enhanced field focus animations
const focusAnimation = useSharedValue(0);
const focusStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  borderColor: interpolateColor(
    focusAnimation.value,
    [0, 1],
    ['#e5e7eb', '#3b82f6']
  ),
  transform: [{ scale: withSpring(1 + focusAnimation.value * 0.02) }],
}));
```

### 2. **Enhanced Shimmer Animations**
```typescript
// Advanced shimmer with color interpolation
const shimmerAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
  const shimmerColor = rInterpolateColor(
    shimmerProgress.value,
    [0, 0.5, 1],
    [
      'rgba(229, 229, 229, 0.8)',
      'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)',
      'rgba(229, 229, 229, 0.8)'
    ]
  );
  return { backgroundColor: shimmerColor };
});
```

### 3. **Theme Toggle Animations**
```typescript
// Smooth theme transitions with icon rotation
const iconRotation = useSharedValue(isDarkMode ? 180 : 0);
const iconAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [
    { rotate: `${iconRotation.value}deg` },
    { scale: iconScale.value }
  ],
}));
```

### 4. **Modal & Confirmation Animations**
```typescript
// Modal entrance with spring animation
const modalAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ scale: modalScale.value }],
  opacity: modalScale.value,
}));

// Staggered step animations
const stepScale = useSharedValue(0.9);
React.useEffect(() => {
  const delay = index * 200;
  setTimeout(() => {
    stepScale.value = withSpring(1, SPRING_CONFIG);
  }, delay);
}, []);
```
