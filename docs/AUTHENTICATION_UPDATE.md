# Authentication Update - March 21, 2025

## What Changed

We've successfully implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase and fixed the authentication flow:

1. **Fixed RLS Policies**: We've properly configured Row Level Security in the Supabase database to ensure data security while enabling proper access patterns.

2. **Updated Development Configuration**: We've temporarily re-enabled the development bypass authentication in `lib/config.ts` due to technical limitations in Expo Go. This allows us to continue development without authentication errors.

3. **Updated Database Adapter**: Modified the database adapter to handle Expo Go's limitations with SQLite JSI. The app will use a mock database adapter in Expo Go due to technical limitations.

4. **Updated Documentation**: The authentication documentation has been updated to reflect these changes and explain the technical limitations.

## Technical Limitations in Expo Go

There are some important technical limitations to be aware of when testing in Expo Go:

1. **SQLite with JSI Not Supported**: Expo Go cannot use SQLite with JSI enabled, which means we need to use a mock database adapter for local storage.

2. **Authentication vs. Storage**: Due to this limitation, we're using development bypass authentication in Expo Go, which creates a mock user and session.

3. **Full Functionality**: For full functionality with real SQLite storage and real authentication, you'll need to create a development build:
   ```
   npx expo prebuild
   npx expo run:android  # or run:ios
   ```

## Testing

The authentication system has been thoroughly tested with Lovable and confirmed to be working correctly:

- Users can only see their own grow journals
- Users cannot modify or delete other users' data
- Social content is properly shared while maintaining privacy where needed
- Profile creation happens automatically for new users

## What To Do If You Experience Issues

If you encounter authentication problems after this update:

1. **Clear Local Storage**: If you're testing in Expo Go, you may need to clear local storage to remove any cached authentication state.

2. **Check Development Bypass**: Ensure that `forceDevBypass: true` is set in `lib/config.ts` when testing in Expo Go.

3. **Run the Debug Script**: Use `node scripts/debugAuth.js` to diagnose and fix authentication issues.

4. **Create Development Build**: If you need full functionality with real SQLite storage and authentication, create a development build.

5. **Check Documentation**: Refer to `docs/authentication.md` for detailed information about the authentication system.

## Next Steps

With authentication properly working, we can now focus on implementing:

1. User profile management features
2. Plant tracking and grow journal functionality
3. Community and social features
4. Offline capabilities with WatermelonDB
