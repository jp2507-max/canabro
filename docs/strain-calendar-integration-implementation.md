# Strain Calendar Integration Implementation

## Task 6.1: Connect calendar with plant strain characteristics

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Requirements:** R6-AC1, R6-AC5

## Overview

This implementation connects the calendar system with plant strain characteristics to provide personalized scheduling, template recommendations, flowering predictions, and strain comparisons. The system leverages existing strain data to optimize growing schedules and improve cultivation outcomes.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Strain-Specific Task Scheduling

**File:** `lib/services/StrainCalendarIntegrationService.ts`

- **Function:** `scheduleStrainSpecificTasks()`
- **Purpose:** Generates tasks optimized for specific strain characteristics
- **Features:**
  - Adjusts task frequency based on strain type (indica, sativa, hybrid)
  - Modifies task priorities based on grow difficulty
  - Applies strain-specific care requirements
  - Integrates with existing TaskAutomationService

**Strain-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Sativa:** More frequent watering (20% increase), higher training priority, more frequent pruning
- **Indica:** Less frequent feeding (10% decrease), reduced inspection frequency
- **Hybrid:** Balanced approach with slight inspection increase
- **High Difficulty:** Increased inspection frequency and priority

### 2. Strain-Based Template Recommendations

**File:** `components/schedule-templates/StrainTemplateRecommendations.tsx`

- **Function:** `getStrainBasedTemplateRecommendations()`
- **Purpose:** Recommends schedule templates based on strain characteristics
- **Features:**
  - Match scoring algorithm (0-100%)
  - Considers strain type, growing environment, duration, and popularity
  - Provides detailed reasons for each recommendation
  - Interactive UI with template selection

**Match Scoring Criteria:**
- Strain type match: 40% weight
- Environment match: 30% weight
- Duration compatibility: 20% weight
- Usage popularity: 10% weight

### 3. Flowering Time and Harvest Date Predictions

**File:** `components/calendar/FloweringPredictionCard.tsx`

- **Function:** `predictFloweringAndHarvest()`
- **Purpose:** Predicts key cultivation milestones based on strain data
- **Features:**
  - Calculates flowering start date based on strain type
  - Predicts harvest date using flowering time data
  - Provides confidence levels (low, medium, high)
  - Shows prediction factors and reasoning

**Prediction Logic:**
- **Vegetative Period:** Sativa (10 weeks), Indica (7 weeks), Hybrid (8 weeks)
- **Flowering Duration:** Uses strain-specific flowering time data
- **Harvest Date:** Flowering end + 1 week preparation time
- **Confidence:** Based on data completeness and current growth stage

### 4. Strain Comparison for Scheduling Optimization

**File:** `components/calendar/StrainScheduleComparison.tsx`

- **Function:** `compareStrainSchedules()`
- **Purpose:** Compares different strains' schedules for optimization
- **Features:**
  - Task frequency differences analysis
  - Timeline comparison (flowering, harvest, total cycle)
  - Optimization recommendations
  - Visual comparison interface

**Comparison Metrics:**
- Task frequency differences (percentage-based)
- Timeline differences (days)
- Care requirement variations
- Difficulty-based recommendations

### 5. Integration with Existing Plant Data

**File:** `components/calendar/StrainCalendarIntegration.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Main integration component combining all strain features
- **Features:**
  - Unified interface for strain-specific features
  - Modal-based template recommendations
  - Strain comparison interface
  - Graceful handling of missing strain data

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture

```typescript
StrainCalendarIntegrationService
├── scheduleStrainSpecificTasks()     // Core scheduling logic
├── getStrainBasedTemplateRecommendations()  // Template matching
├── predictFloweringAndHarvest()      // Timeline predictions
├── compareStrainSchedules()          // Strain comparison
└── Helper methods for calculations
```

### Data Models Integration

- **Strain Model:** Uses existing `lib/models/Strain.ts`
- **Plant Model:** Leverages `strainId` and `strainObj` relationships
- **ScheduleTemplate:** Utilizes `strainType` field for matching
- **PlantTask:** Enhanced with strain-specific modifications

### UI Components

```
components/
├── calendar/
│   ├── FloweringPredictionCard.tsx
│   ├── StrainScheduleComparison.tsx
│   └── StrainCalendarIntegration.tsx
└── schedule-templates/
    └── StrainTemplateRecommendations.tsx
```

## Requirements Fulfillment

### R6-AC1: Consider plant strain characteristics when scheduling tasks

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- `scheduleStrainSpecificTasks()` adjusts task frequency and priority based on strain type
- Strain-specific care requirements applied to all generated tasks
- Integration with existing TaskAutomationService maintains compatibility

### R6-AC5: Show how different schedules affected outcomes when comparing plants

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- `compareStrainSchedules()` provides detailed comparison metrics
- Task frequency differences highlighted with percentage changes
- Timeline differences shown in days for easy comparison
- Optimization recommendations generated based on strain characteristics

## Usage Examples

### 1. Schedule Strain-Specific Tasks

```typescript
const tasks = await StrainCalendarIntegrationService.scheduleStrainSpecificTasks(
  plant,
  'vegetative'
);
```

### 2. Get Template Recommendations

```typescript
const recommendations = await StrainCalendarIntegrationService.getStrainBasedTemplateRecommendations(
  strainId,
  'indoor'
);
```

### 3. Predict Flowering and Harvest

```typescript
const prediction = await StrainCalendarIntegrationService.predictFloweringAndHarvest(plant);
```

### 4. Compare Strain Schedules

```typescript
const comparison = await StrainCalendarIntegrationService.compareStrainSchedules(
  strainIdA,
  strainIdB
);
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** `lib/services/__tests__/StrainCalendarIntegrationService.test.ts`
- **Integration Test:** `lib/services/integration-test.ts`
- **Component Tests:** Individual component test files

### Test Scenarios

- Strain-specific task generation
- Template recommendation scoring
- Flowering prediction accuracy
- Strain comparison calculations
- Error handling for missing data

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

- **Caching:** Strain data cached during service calls
- **Batch Operations:** Database writes batched for efficiency
- **Lazy Loading:** Components load data only when needed
- **Memoization:** React components use proper memoization

### Memory Management

- Proper cleanup of animation references
- Efficient data structures for comparisons
- Minimal re-renders through stable references

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

- Missing strain data: Falls back to default scheduling
- Invalid strain IDs: Returns empty results with logging
- Network errors: Retry mechanisms with user feedback
- Component errors: Error boundaries prevent crashes

### User Experience

- Loading states for all async operations
- Clear error messages with retry options
- Fallback content when data unavailable
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems

- **TaskAutomationService:** Enhanced with strain-specific logic

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Machine Learning:** Learn from user completion patterns
2. **Environmental Integration:** Factor in weather and sensor data
3. **Community Data:** Aggregate strain performance across users
4. **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed outcome tracking and optimization

### Scalability Considerations

- Service architecture supports additional strain data sources
