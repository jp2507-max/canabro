- **Key Features**:
  - Unified interface for harvest operations
  - Automatic harvest preparation triggering
  - Harvest processing workflow
  - Prediction updates and task management
  - Integration with existing plant and task systems

## Requirements Fulfillment

### R4-AC3: "WHEN a plant is harvested THEN the system SHALL archive its tasks and show harvest timeline"
✅ **Implemented in PostHarvestScheduler.markPlantAsHarvested()**
- Archives existing active tasks when plant is harvested
- Updates plant growth stage to 'harvested'
- Creates comprehensive post-harvest task timeline
- Maintains harvest date and weight data

### R6-AC4: "WHEN harvest data is recorded THEN the system SHALL use it to improve future scheduling"
✅ **Implemented in HarvestDataIntegrator.updateFutureScheduling()**
- Analyzes harvest performance vs predictions
- Updates expected harvest dates for similar plants
- Adjusts task schedules based on completion rates
- Applies lessons learned to future grows

### R6-AC5: "WHEN comparing plants THEN the calendar SHALL show how different schedules affected outcomes"
✅ **Implemented in HarvestDataIntegrator.compareHarvests()**
- Comprehensive harvest comparison analytics
- Success factor identification
- Performance correlation analysis
- Schedule effectiveness evaluation
- Improvement recommendations based on outcomes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Models Integration
- Extends existing Plant model with harvest-related fields
- Utilizes PlantTask model for preparation and post-harvest tasks
- Integrates with PlantMetrics for readiness assessment
- Maintains compatibility with existing WatermelonDB schema

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Batch operations for task creation and updates
- Caching of frequently accessed prediction data
- Background processing for analytics calculations

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when prediction data is incomplete
- Fallback mechanisms for missing strain information
- Robust error recovery in task scheduling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing task management system
- Compatible with current notification infrastructure
- Works with existing plant management workflows
- Maintains consistency with app theming and UI patterns

## Usage Examples

### Basic Harvest Prediction
```typescript
import { HarvestPredictionService } from '@/lib/services';

const prediction = await HarvestPredictionService.predictHarvestDate(plant);
console.log(`Harvest predicted in ${prediction.daysRemaining} days`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${prediction.confidence}`);
```

### Automatic Preparation Tasks
```typescript
import { HarvestPreparationAutomator } from '@/lib/services';

// Auto-trigger for multiple plants
await HarvestPreparationAutomator.autoTriggerHarvestPreparation(floweringPlants);

// Manual trigger for specific plant
await HarvestPreparationAutomator.scheduleHarvestPreparationTasks(plant);
```

### Harvest Processing
```typescript
import { PostHarvestScheduler } from '@/lib/services';

await PostHarvestScheduler.markPlantAsHarvested(plant, {
  harvestDate: new Date(),
  wetWeight: 450, // grams
  notes: 'Excellent trichome development'
});
```

### Analytics and Planning
```typescript
import { HarvestDataIntegrator } from '@/lib/services';

const comparison = await HarvestDataIntegrator.compareHarvests(harvestedPlants);
const planning = await HarvestDataIntegrator.generateFuturePlanningData(harvestedPlants);
```

### UI Integration
```typescript
import { HarvestIntegrationManager } from '@/components/task-management';

<HarvestIntegrationManager
  plants={plants}
  onNavigateToPlant={handlePlantNavigation}
  onNavigateToTasks={handleTaskNavigation}
  mode="dashboard" // or "timeline"
/>
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use historical data to improve prediction accuracy
