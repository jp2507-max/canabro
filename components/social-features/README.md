## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies **Requirement 4: Enhanced Social Features** from the specification:

1. ‚úÖ Users can follow other growers and build social connections
2. ‚úÖ Users can see activity from followed users in their feed
3. ‚úÖ Users earn recognition through achievements and reputation scores
4. ‚úÖ Users can join interest groups and connect with similar growers
5. ‚úÖ Users are recognized for valuable contributions through ratings and badges

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { SocialGroups } from '@/components/social-features';

function SocialGroupsScreen() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <SocialGroups
      currentUserId={user?.id}
      initialTab="discover"
      onGroupSelect={(groupId) => {
        // Handle group selection
        console.log('Selected group:', groupId);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Navigation Integration

```tsx
// In your navigation stack
<Stack.Screen 
  name="SocialGroups" 
  component={SocialGroupsScreen}
  options={{ 
    title: 'Groups',
    headerShown: false // Component has its own header
  }}
/>
```

## Translations

Translation keys have been added to `lib/locales/en.json` under the `socialGroups` namespace:

- `socialGroups.title` - Main title
- `socialGroups.tabs.*` - Tab labels
- `socialGroups.form.*` - Form labels and validation
- `socialGroups.discovery.*` - Discovery interface
- `socialGroups.content.*` - Group content interface
- `socialGroups.moderation.*` - Moderation interface

## Performance Considerations

- Uses `FlashListWrapper` for all large lists (groups, members)
- Implements proper virtualization with `estimatedItemSize`
- Uses React Native Reanimated v3.19.0+ with automatic workletization
- Debounced search queries to reduce database load
- Optimized re-renders with `useCallback` and `useMemo`

## Database Integration

The implementation uses WatermelonDB for offline-first data management:

- Groups are stored locally and synced with Supabase
- Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime (when implemented)
- Proper query optimization with indexes
- Batch operations for member management

## Future Enhancements

The following features are prepared for but not fully implemented:

1. **Real-time messaging** within groups
2. **Push notifications** for group activity
3. **File sharing** within groups
4. **Group events** and scheduling
5. **Advanced analytics** for group engagement

## Testing

Basic tests are included in `__tests__/SocialGroups.test.tsx`. To run tests:

```bash
npm test -- components/social-features/__tests__/SocialGroups.test.tsx
```

## Dependencies

This implementation leverages existing CanaBro utilities and follows established patterns:

- **React Native Reanimated v3.19.0+** for animations
- **WatermelonDB** for local data storage
- **Supabase** for backend services
- **i18next** for internationalization
- **@shopify/flash-list** for performance
- **react-native-gesture-handler** for interactions

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows the CanaBro architecture guidelines:

- ‚úÖ Uses NativeWind v4 for styling
- ‚úÖ Follows TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ Uses existing UI component patterns
- ‚úÖ Implements proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Supports dark/light themes
- ‚úÖ Includes accessibility features
- ‚úÖ Uses semantic color tokens

```tsx
import { UserAchievements } from '@/components/social-features';
import { useAchievements } from '@/lib/hooks/useAchievements';

function ProfileScreen() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  const handleAchievementUnlocked = (achievement) => {
    // Trigger celebration UI
    showCelebrationModal(achievement);
  };
  
  return (
    <UserAchievements
      userId={user.id}
      userStats={userStats}
      onAchievementUnlocked={handleAchievementUnlocked}

// Achievement unlocks trigger notifications
const { scheduleNotification } = useNotifications();

await scheduleNotification({
  identifier: `achievement_${achievementId}`,
  title: 'Achievement Unlocked! üèÜ',
  body: `Congratulations! You've unlocked: ${title}`,

  scheduledFor: new Date(Date.now() + 1000),
});
```

#### Stats Updates
```tsx
// Update user stats when actions are performed
const { updateStats } = useAchievements({ userId });

// When user adds a plant
await updateStats('growing', {
  plantsGrown: currentCount + 1
});

// When user helps community
await updateStats('community', {
  helpfulAnswers: currentCount + 1
});
```
