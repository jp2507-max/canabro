How to Avoid "Text strings must be rendered within a component" Errors in React Native
I've fixed the issue by removing all problematic inline comments from your components. The error "Text strings must be rendered within a component" is a common React Native issue that occurs when text content is rendered directly inside a View component instead of being wrapped in a Text component.

Why This Error Happens
In React Native, unlike in web development:

Text can only be rendered inside <Text> components
Comments in JSX that appear after a component's closing tag or between sibling components can sometimes be interpreted as text nodes
Inline comments (using // after JSX attributes) can cause issues
How to Avoid This Error When Creating New Screens
Never place comments inside View components as siblings to other components
jsx
CopyInsert
// BAD - will cause error
<View>
  <SomeComponent />
  // This comment will cause an error
</View>

// GOOD
<View>
  {/* This comment is safe */}
  <SomeComponent />
</View>
Avoid inline comments after JSX attributes
jsx
CopyInsert
// BAD - might cause error
<View style={{ margin: 10 }} // This comment can cause issues
>

// GOOD
{/* Comment about the margin */}
<View style={{ margin: 10 }}>
Always wrap text in <Text> or <ThemedText> components
jsx
CopyInsert
// BAD - will cause error
<View>
  Hello World
</View>

// GOOD
<View>
  <Text>Hello World</Text>
</View>
Be careful with string literals in JSX
jsx
CopyInsert
// BAD - might cause error
<View>
  {someCondition && "Some text"}
</View>

// GOOD
<View>
  {someCondition && <Text>Some text</Text>}
</View>
Place comments before the component they describe
jsx
CopyInsert
// GOOD
{/* Comment about the component */}
<Component />
By following these guidelines, you should be able to avoid the "Text strings must be rendered within a component" error when creating or redesigning screens in your React Native app.
