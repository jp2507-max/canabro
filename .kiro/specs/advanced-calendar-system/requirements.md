# Advanced Calendar System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Calendar System will transform CanaBro's basic task scheduling into a comprehensive growing calendar with visual timeline views, automated reminders, and custom schedule templates. This system will provide cannabis growers with professional-grade cultivation planning and tracking capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Calendar Interface

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want a visual calendar interface to see all my plant care tasks and growth milestones at a glance, so that I can plan my cultivation activities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the calendar view THEN they SHALL see a monthly calendar with plant care tasks displayed
2. WHEN viewing the calendar THEN the system SHALL show different task types with color-coded indicators
3. WHEN a user taps on a date THEN the system SHALL display all tasks scheduled for that day
4. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL show plant names, task types, and priority levels
5. WHEN switching between months THEN the system SHALL load tasks efficiently without performance issues

### Requirement 2: Automated Growth Reminders

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want automated reminders based on plant growth stages, so that I never miss critical care activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plant enters a new growth stage THEN the system SHALL automatically schedule appropriate care tasks
2. WHEN a care task is due THEN the system SHALL send push notifications with plant-specific details
3. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically schedule the next occurrence based on plant needs
4. WHEN environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust reminder schedules accordingly
5. WHEN multiple plants need attention THEN the system SHALL batch notifications to avoid spam

### Requirement 3: Custom Schedule Templates

**User Story:** As an experienced grower, I want to create and share custom growing schedules, so that I can standardize my cultivation process and help other growers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a schedule template THEN the user SHALL be able to define tasks for each growth stage
2. WHEN saving a template THEN the system SHALL allow naming and categorizing the schedule
3. WHEN applying a template THEN the system SHALL automatically create all scheduled tasks for a plant
4. WHEN sharing templates THEN other users SHALL be able to import and use them
5. WHEN modifying templates THEN existing plants using the template SHALL optionally update their schedules

### Requirement 4: Plant Lifecycle Integration

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want the calendar to automatically track my plants' growth stages and adjust schedules accordingly, so that care recommendations stay relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plant's growth stage changes THEN the calendar SHALL update future task schedules automatically
2. WHEN viewing calendar tasks THEN the system SHALL show which growth stage each plant is in
3. WHEN a plant is harvested THEN the system SHALL archive its tasks and show harvest timeline
4. WHEN planning new grows THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal planting dates based on available space
5. WHEN multiple plants are at different stages THEN the calendar SHALL clearly distinguish their care needs

### Requirement 5: Task Management and Completion

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want to easily mark tasks as complete and track my cultivation history, so that I can learn from past grows and improve my techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing a task THEN the user SHALL be able to add notes and photos
2. WHEN a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL highlight it with visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing task history THEN the user SHALL see completion rates and patterns
4. WHEN rescheduling tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain the original schedule for reference
5. WHEN bulk completing tasks THEN the user SHALL be able to select multiple tasks at once

### Requirement 6: Integration with Plant Data

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want the calendar to use my plant data to provide personalized scheduling, so that each plant gets appropriate care based on its specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling tasks THEN the system SHALL consider plant strain characteristics
2. WHEN a plant shows health issues THEN the calendar SHALL suggest additional care tasks
3. WHEN environmental data is available THEN the system SHALL adjust watering and feeding schedules
4. WHEN harvest data is recorded THEN the system SHALL use it to improve future scheduling
5. WHEN comparing plants THEN the calendar SHALL show how different schedules affected outcomes
