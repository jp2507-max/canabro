# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing FlashList components from v1 to v2 to leverage the new architecture improvements, automatic sizing, and enhanced performance optimizations. FlashList v2 is a ground-up rewrite that requires React Native's new architecture and provides significant performance improvements including faster load times, improved scrolling performance, and precise rendering without requiring manual item size estimates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use FlashList v2's automatic sizing capabilities, so that I don't need to manually provide size estimates and get better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FlashListWrapper component is used THEN it SHALL NOT require estimatedItemSize prop
2. WHEN FlashList renders items THEN it SHALL automatically calculate item sizes without manual estimates
3. WHEN the component is initialized THEN it SHALL use FlashList v2's automatic sizing system
4. WHEN items are rendered THEN the system SHALL provide optimal performance without size estimation overhead

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the new maintainVisibleContentPosition feature, so that scroll position is maintained automatically when content changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is added to the list THEN the system SHALL maintain the current scroll position automatically
2. WHEN maintainVisibleContentPosition is configured THEN it SHALL support autoscrollToTopThreshold and autoscrollToBottomThreshold
3. WHEN the list is used for chat interfaces THEN it SHALL support startRenderingFromBottom option
4. WHEN content changes occur THEN visible glitches SHALL be minimized through automatic position maintenance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the updated ref types and API, so that I have proper TypeScript support and access to all v2 methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using FlashList refs THEN the system SHALL use FlashListRef<T> type instead of FlashList<T>
2. WHEN importing FlashList components THEN it SHALL import both FlashList and FlashListRef types
3. WHEN accessing list methods THEN all v2 API methods SHALL be properly typed and accessible
4. WHEN using the ref THEN it SHALL provide access to scrollToIndex, scrollToEnd, and other v2 methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the new masonry layout capabilities, so that I can create grid layouts with varying item heights efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating masonry layouts THEN the system SHALL use the masonry prop instead of MasonryFlashList component
2. WHEN masonry is enabled THEN it SHALL work with numColumns to define grid structure
3. WHEN using overrideItemLayout THEN it SHALL only support span changes, not size estimates
4. WHEN masonry layout is active THEN items SHALL be arranged efficiently with varying heights

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the enhanced performance utilities, so that I can optimize large lists with better memory management and scroll performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide optimized performance configurations
2. WHEN managing memory usage THEN it SHALL include intelligent caching and cleanup mechanisms
3. WHEN scrolling through lists THEN performance SHALL be optimized with proper event throttling
4. WHEN using performance presets THEN they SHALL be tailored for different use cases (messages, feeds, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the new hooks (useLayoutState, useRecyclingState), so that I can manage item state efficiently across recycling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items need local state THEN useLayoutState SHALL communicate state changes directly to FlashList
2. WHEN state needs to reset on recycling THEN useRecyclingState SHALL automatically reset based on dependencies
3. WHEN items are recycled THEN state management SHALL be handled efficiently without memory leaks
4. WHEN layout changes occur THEN the hooks SHALL provide smooth visual updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility for existing implementations, so that the migration doesn't break current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing FlashListWrapper usage is maintained THEN it SHALL continue to work with sensible defaults
2. WHEN migrating from v1 THEN deprecated props SHALL be handled gracefully or provide clear migration paths
3. WHEN the wrapper is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same external API while using v2 internally
4. WHEN performance utilities are updated THEN existing usage patterns SHALL remain functional
