# Production Infrastructure - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Production Infrastructure system will establish the foundational deployment, monitoring, and operational capabilities needed for CanaBro's production launch. This system covers EAS Updates, push notifications, analytics, error monitoring, and automated deployment processes to ensure reliable, scalable, and maintainable production operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Over-the-Air Updates (EAS Update)

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to deploy app updates instantly without requiring users to download from app stores, so that I can quickly fix bugs and deliver new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a critical bug is fixed THEN the system SHALL deploy updates to users within 15 minutes
2. WHEN updates are deployed THEN users SHALL receive them automatically on next app launch
3. WHEN updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous stable version
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support staged rollouts to percentage of users
5. WHEN updates are available THEN users SHALL see optional update prompts for non-critical updates

### Requirement 2: Push Notification Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want to receive timely notifications about my plants and community activity, so that I never miss important care tasks or engagement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plant care is due THEN the system SHALL send push notifications with plant-specific details
2. WHEN community members interact with my content THEN I SHALL receive engagement notifications
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL respect user preferences and quiet hours
4. WHEN notifications fail to deliver THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN users tap notifications THEN they SHALL deep link to relevant app screens

### Requirement 3: Analytics and User Behavior Tracking

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive analytics about user behavior and app performance, so that I can make data-driven decisions about feature development and improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with features THEN the system SHALL track usage patterns and engagement metrics
2. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL provide insights about feature adoption and retention
3. WHEN tracking events THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy preferences and GDPR compliance
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards and historical trends
5. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders about significant metric changes

### Requirement 4: Error Monitoring and Crash Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error monitoring and crash reporting, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues affecting users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN app crashes occur THEN the system SHALL automatically capture and report crash details
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide stack traces, user context, and reproduction steps
3. WHEN critical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL alert the development team immediately
4. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL group similar issues and track resolution status
5. WHEN errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL verify the fix effectiveness through monitoring

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time performance monitoring, so that I can ensure the app runs smoothly for all users across different devices and conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track app startup time, screen load times, and API response times
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert developers before users are significantly impacted
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide device-specific and network-condition breakdowns
4. WHEN optimizing features THEN the system SHALL provide before/after performance comparisons
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for resolution

### Requirement 6: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment processes, so that I can release updates safely and efficiently without manual errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run tests and build processes
2. WHEN builds pass all tests THEN the system SHALL deploy to staging environment for validation
3. WHEN staging validation passes THEN the system SHALL enable one-click production deployment
4. WHEN deployments fail THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback and notify the team
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL maintain deployment history and enable easy rollbacks

### Requirement 7: Environment Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment separation and configuration management, so that I can safely test changes without affecting production users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL provide separate development, staging, and production environments
2. WHEN configuring environments THEN the system SHALL manage secrets and API keys securely
3. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate configurations automatically
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL validate changes before deployment
5. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL rotate keys regularly and track access
