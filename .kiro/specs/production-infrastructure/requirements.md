# Production Infrastructure Setup - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Production Infrastructure Setup will establish the essential systems needed for CanaBro's production deployment and ongoing operations. This includes over-the-air updates, push notifications, analytics tracking, error monitoring, and deployment automation to ensure a reliable, scalable, and maintainable production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates System

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to deploy app updates instantly without requiring users to download from app stores, so that I can quickly fix bugs and deliver new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new app version is ready THEN the system SHALL deploy updates via EAS Update automatically
2. WHEN users open the app THEN they SHALL receive updates seamlessly in the background
3. WHEN critical updates are available THEN the system SHALL force update with user notification
4. WHEN updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous stable version
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support staged rollouts to minimize risk

### Requirement 2: Push Notification Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want to receive timely notifications about my plants and community activity, so that I never miss important care tasks or engagement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the app THEN the system SHALL request notification permissions appropriately
2. WHEN plant care is due THEN the system SHALL send personalized push notifications
3. WHEN community activity occurs THEN users SHALL receive relevant engagement notifications
4. WHEN users interact with notifications THEN the app SHALL deep link to relevant screens
5. WHEN notification preferences change THEN the system SHALL respect user choices immediately

### Requirement 3: Analytics and User Behavior Tracking

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive analytics about user behavior and app performance, so that I can make data-driven decisions for product improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the app THEN the system SHALL track key user actions and flows
2. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL provide insights into feature usage patterns
3. WHEN monitoring app performance THEN the system SHALL track technical metrics and crashes
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the data SHALL be presented in actionable dashboards
5. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy regulations and user consent

### Requirement 4: Error Monitoring and Crash Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error monitoring and crash reporting, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues affecting users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically capture and report them with context
2. WHEN crashes happen THEN the system SHALL provide detailed crash reports with stack traces
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert the development team immediately
4. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL provide trends and impact analysis
5. WHEN errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL track resolution and verify fixes

### Requirement 5: Deployment Automation and CI/CD

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment pipelines, so that I can deploy updates safely and efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run tests and quality checks
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build and deploy to staging environments automatically
3. WHEN staging validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL enable production deployment with approval
4. WHEN deployments fail THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback and notify the team
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL maintain deployment history and audit trails

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want real-time performance monitoring, so that I can ensure optimal user experience and identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring app performance THEN the system SHALL track key metrics like load times and responsiveness
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert the team with specific metrics and context
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights into optimization opportunities
4. WHEN users experience issues THEN the system SHALL correlate performance data with user reports
5. WHEN optimizations are deployed THEN the system SHALL measure and report improvement impact

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want robust security monitoring and compliance tracking, so that the app meets regulatory requirements and protects user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive security monitoring
2. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log and alert on suspicious activities
3. WHEN compliance audits are needed THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trails
4. WHEN data breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL execute incident response procedures
5. WHEN regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt compliance monitoring accordingly
