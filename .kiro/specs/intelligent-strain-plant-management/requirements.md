# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Strain-Based Plant Management feature will integrate detailed strain API data with the plant management system to provide personalized, strain-specific cultivation guidance. Instead of generic cannabis plant tracking, users will receive tailored schedules, predictions, and recommendations based on their selected strain's unique characteristics including flowering time, harvest windows, yield expectations, and growth patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cannabis grower, I want my plant's care schedule automatically customized based on my selected strain's specific characteristics, so that I can follow optimal timing for flowering, harvesting, and other critical tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a strain during plant creation THEN the system SHALL parse and store relevant cultivation data from the strain API response
2. WHEN strain data includes flowering time (e.g., "7-9 weeks") THEN the system SHALL generate strain-specific task schedules with appropriate timing
3. WHEN strain data includes harvest timing (e.g., "End of September/October") THEN the system SHALL calculate and display predicted harvest dates
4. WHEN strain data includes grow difficulty (e.g., "Easy", "Medium", "Hard") THEN the system SHALL adjust task frequency and guidance complexity accordingly
5. WHEN strain data is successfully integrated THEN the plant's timeline SHALL reflect strain-specific milestones rather than generic cannabis schedules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user planning my grow, I want to see realistic yield expectations and space requirements based on my selected strain, so that I can properly prepare my growing environment and set achievable goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strain data includes yield information (e.g., "700g/plant", "Medium") THEN the system SHALL display expected yield ranges in the plant details
2. WHEN strain data includes height information (e.g., "Medium", "Tall") THEN the system SHALL provide space planning recommendations
3. WHEN strain data includes indoor/outdoor preferences THEN the system SHALL highlight optimal growing environments
4. WHEN multiple plants of the same strain are tracked THEN the system SHALL aggregate yield predictions for harvest planning
5. WHEN yield data is available THEN the system SHALL track actual vs. predicted yields for learning and improvement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a beginner grower, I want strain-specific guidance and tips based on the difficulty level and characteristics of my chosen strain, so that I can successfully cultivate plants that match my experience level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strain data indicates "Easy" difficulty THEN the system SHALL provide simplified task descriptions and beginner-friendly guidance
2. WHEN strain data indicates "Hard" difficulty THEN the system SHALL include advanced tips, warnings, and detailed monitoring recommendations
3. WHEN strain genetics indicate specific characteristics (e.g., "Indica 90-100%") THEN the system SHALL provide relevant growth pattern guidance
4. WHEN strain has specific environmental needs THEN the system SHALL generate targeted care reminders and alerts
5. WHEN strain-specific problems are common THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest preventive measures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an experienced grower, I want access to detailed strain information including genetics, effects, and cultivation history, so that I can make informed decisions and optimize my growing techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strain data includes genetic information THEN the system SHALL display parent strains and genetic composition
2. WHEN strain data includes THC/CBD levels THEN the system SHALL show potency expectations and testing recommendations
3. WHEN strain data includes flavor and aroma profiles THEN the system SHALL display expected sensory characteristics
4. WHEN strain data includes effects information THEN the system SHALL show anticipated user experience outcomes
5. WHEN historical cultivation data is available THEN the system SHALL provide insights on optimal growing conditions and common challenges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user tracking multiple plants, I want to compare strain-specific schedules and requirements across different varieties, so that I can efficiently manage diverse grows and optimize my cultivation workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user has multiple plants with different strains THEN the system SHALL display comparative timelines and schedules
2. WHEN strains have conflicting environmental needs THEN the system SHALL highlight compatibility issues and suggest solutions
3. WHEN harvest times vary significantly between strains THEN the system SHALL optimize task scheduling to minimize conflicts
4. WHEN strains have different difficulty levels THEN the system SHALL prioritize attention and resources appropriately
5. WHEN planning new plants THEN the system SHALL recommend compatible strains based on existing grow schedules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to learn and improve, I want the system to track how well strain predictions matched my actual results, so that I can refine my techniques and make better strain selections in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plant reaches harvest THEN the system SHALL compare actual vs. predicted flowering time, yield, and quality metrics
2. WHEN strain predictions are inaccurate THEN the system SHALL learn from user feedback and adjust future recommendations
3. WHEN user provides cultivation environment details THEN the system SHALL refine strain-specific guidance based on local conditions
4. WHEN multiple grows of the same strain are completed THEN the system SHALL build personalized strain profiles and success patterns
5. WHEN user searches for new strains THEN the system SHALL recommend varieties based on past success with similar genetics and characteristics
