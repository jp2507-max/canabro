14. Establish data breach response plans with 72-hour notification procedures
15. Implement React Native-specific security measures (secure storage, code obfuscation, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
1. Run automated security scanning tools specialized for React Native applications
2. Perform manual penetration testing with cannabis industry attack vectors
3. Verify data encryption at rest and in transit using 2025 recommended encryption standards
4. Test data export and deletion functionality against CCPA 2025 requirements
5. Validate compliance with GDPR/CCPA requirements using updated 2025 checklists
6. Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing
7. Test consumer rights implementation (access, deletion, portability)
8. Verify proper implementation of consent mechanisms and privacy notices
9. Validate secure handling of cannabis-specific sensitive data
10. Test third-party data sharing controls and documentation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Static Code Analysis & Vulnerability Assessment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive static code analysis on the React Native codebase to identify security vulnerabilities, with special focus on cannabis-specific data handling patterns.
### Details:
Implement automated SAST tools to scan for hard-coded secrets, insecure API calls, and common React Native vulnerabilities. Review dependencies for known CVEs and security issues. Focus on cannabis-specific data handling patterns that might expose sensitive information. Generate a detailed vulnerability report categorized by severity.

## 2. API Security Enhancement & Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Secure all API endpoints through penetration testing, implementation of token-based authentication, rate limiting, and encrypted data transmission.
### Details:
Conduct penetration testing on all API endpoints with focus on cannabis-specific vulnerabilities. Implement token-based authentication with short expiration times, rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, and ensure all data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3. Add certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks and implement integrity checks to detect API response tampering.

## 3. Secure Data Storage Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement secure storage mechanisms for sensitive user and cannabis-related data with proper encryption and access controls.
### Details:
Use React Native's SecureStore or equivalent for storing sensitive information. Implement AES-256 encryption for all cannabis-related user data. Add code obfuscation to protect encryption keys. Implement root/jailbreak detection to prevent unauthorized access to stored data. Create a data classification system to ensure appropriate security controls are applied based on sensitivity levels.

## 4. GDPR Compliance Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement GDPR-compliant user data management based on 2025 standards, including consent mechanisms, data minimization, and right to be forgotten.
### Details:
Create granular consent mechanisms for all data collection. Implement data minimization by only collecting necessary information. Build user-accessible privacy dashboards showing all stored data. Develop data deletion functionality with complete removal from all systems. Implement data portability features allowing users to export their data in common formats. Ensure all third-party services used are GDPR compliant.

## 5. CCPA Compliance Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement CCPA-specific requirements including personal information inventory, opt-out mechanisms, and data subject request handling.
### Details:
Build a comprehensive personal information inventory documenting all PII processed in the application. Implement a prominent "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" option. Create automated workflows for handling data subject requests within the required timeframes. Develop age verification mechanisms to comply with cannabis-specific regulations. Implement record-keeping of all data subject requests as required by CCPA.

## 6. Authentication & Session Security Enhancement [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement secure authentication mechanisms including biometric options, session management, and secure logout functionality.
### Details:
Integrate biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) as an optional security layer. Implement secure session management with appropriate timeout settings. Create secure logout functionality that properly invalidates tokens and clears sensitive data. Add multi-factor authentication for high-risk operations. Implement progressive security measures based on risk assessment of user actions.

## 7. App Shielding & Runtime Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Implement layered security protections including code obfuscation, anti-tampering measures, and runtime application self-protection.
### Details:
Implement code obfuscation to protect business logic and security mechanisms. Add root/jailbreak detection with appropriate responses. Implement emulator detection to prevent automated attacks. Add integrity checks to detect app tampering after installation. Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) to detect and respond to attacks during execution. Create a response strategy for detected security violations.

## 8. Security Documentation & Incident Response Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7
### Description: Create comprehensive security documentation including privacy policies, terms of service, and data breach response procedures.
### Details:
Develop privacy policy and terms of service documents compliant with 2025 GDPR/CCPA regulations. Create a detailed data breach response plan with 72-hour notification procedures. Document all security measures implemented in the application. Develop security training materials for developers and users. Create a vulnerability disclosure policy and bug bounty program guidelines. Establish regular security audit schedules and documentation requirements.
