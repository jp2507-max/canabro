# Task ID: 8
# Title: Analytics & Monitoring Integration (2025 Best Practices)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive analytics, error tracking, and performance monitoring for the production environment, following 2025 best practices for React Native cannabis apps.
# Details:
1. Define clear goals and select KPIs aligned with cannabis app business objectives (e.g., retention, conversion, compliance events)[1][3][5].
2. Integrate crash/error reporting (Sentry/Bugsnag) and monitor technical performance (crashes, latency, network requests, battery usage)[3].
3. Implement user behavior analytics, including onboarding completion, session duration, and feature engagement[2][5].
4. Set up custom event tracking for key user actions, including regulatory/compliance events unique to cannabis apps.
5. Configure performance monitoring for critical screens and API response times, with real-time alerting for critical issues[3].
6. Segment users by behavior and demographics (age, region, compliance status) for granular insights[3].
7. Create analytics dashboards visualizing key metrics and conversion funnels for user journeys (e.g., onboarding, purchase, compliance verification)[1][2][5].
8. Implement user session recording with privacy safeguards and compliance with cannabis industry regulations.
9. Set up A/B testing framework for post-launch optimization, using analytics to inform experiment design and measure impact[1][3].
10. Integrate analytics with third-party tools (marketing, support) via secure data connectors, ensuring privacy, security, and regulatory compliance[1].

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all analytics events are tracked and mapped to defined KPIs and user journeys[1][2][5].
2. Simulate crashes and performance issues to test error reporting and alerting.
3. Validate onboarding and compliance event tracking.
4. Test dashboards for real-time and segmented data visualization.
5. Confirm privacy and regulatory compliance in all analytics data collection and integrations.
