3. Test age verification functionality and ensure it meets current standards
4. Verify content warnings and disclaimers display correctly and are appropriately worded
5. Test geo-restriction functionality to ensure content is inaccessible in prohibited regions
6. Confirm that no in-app shopping cart, ordering, or delivery facilitation features exist, especially for Google Play
7. Review app positioning and educational content for compliance with best practices
