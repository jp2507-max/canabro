# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement German Localization and i18n System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Translate the entire app UI to German including all static and dynamic content, implement a robust i18n solution, and ensure API data in the strains screen is translated before display.
# Details:
1. **Set up i18n Infrastructure:**
   - Install and configure react-i18next or similar i18n library for React Native
   - Create language detection and switching mechanisms
   - Set up translation file structure (en.json, de.json) with proper namespacing
   - Implement context providers for language state management across the app

2. **Static Content Translation:**
   - Extract all hardcoded strings from UI components into translation keys
   - Create comprehensive German translations for all UI elements including buttons, labels, headers, navigation items, and form fields
   - Translate error messages, validation messages, and user feedback notifications
   - Ensure proper handling of pluralization rules for German language
   - Implement date, time, and number formatting for German locale

3. **Dynamic Content Translation:**
   - Identify all API endpoints that return user-facing content for the strains screen
   - Implement translation middleware or service to translate API responses before display
   - Create mapping system for strain-related terminology (strain names, effects, flavors, etc.)
   - Handle mixed content scenarios where some data is translated and some remains in original language
   - Implement caching mechanism for translated content to improve performance

4. **Strains Screen Specific Implementation:**
   - Translate strain categories, effects, and descriptive text
   - Implement real-time translation for user-generated content if applicable
   - Handle image alt-text and accessibility labels in German
   - Ensure proper text layout and UI adjustments for German text length differences

5. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Use translation hooks (useTranslation) throughout components
   - Implement lazy loading for translation files to optimize bundle size
   - Add fallback mechanisms for missing translations
   - Ensure proper text direction and layout adjustments for German text
   - Implement translation key validation and missing translation detection

# Test Strategy:
1. **Translation Completeness Testing:**
   - Audit entire app to ensure no hardcoded strings remain untranslated
   - Verify all UI elements display German text correctly on both iOS and Android
   - Test language switching functionality and persistence across app restarts
   - Validate that all error messages and notifications appear in German

2. **Strains Screen Translation Testing:**
   - Verify all API data in strains screen is properly translated before display
   - Test strain categories, effects, and descriptions show German translations
   - Confirm mixed content scenarios handle translation appropriately
   - Validate caching mechanism works correctly for translated strain data

3. **Functional Testing:**
   - Test app functionality remains intact after translation implementation
   - Verify forms, navigation, and user interactions work correctly in German
   - Test text input and search functionality with German characters and umlauts
   - Confirm date/time formatting displays correctly for German locale

4. **UI/UX Testing:**
   - Test text layout and spacing with longer German text strings
   - Verify UI components don't break or overflow with German translations
   - Test on various screen sizes and orientations on both platforms
   - Validate accessibility features work correctly with German content

5. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure app startup time with i18n implementation
   - Test translation loading performance and caching effectiveness
   - Verify memory usage remains acceptable with translation files loaded
