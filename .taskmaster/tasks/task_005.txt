# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement German Localization and i18n System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Translate the entire app UI to German including all static and dynamic content, implement a robust i18n solution, and ensure API data in the strains screen is translated before display.
# Details:
1. **Set up i18n Infrastructure:**
   - Install and configure react-i18next or similar i18n library for React Native
   - Create language detection and switching mechanisms
   - Set up translation file structure (en.json, de.json) with proper namespacing
   - Implement context providers for language state management across the app

2. **Static Content Translation:**
   - Extract all hardcoded strings from UI components into translation keys
   - Create comprehensive German translations for all UI elements including buttons, labels, headers, navigation items, and form fields
   - Translate error messages, validation messages, and user feedback notifications
   - Ensure proper handling of pluralization rules for German language
   - Implement date, time, and number formatting for German locale

3. **Dynamic Content Translation:**
   - Identify all API endpoints that return user-facing content for the strains screen
   - Implement translation middleware or service to translate API responses before display
   - Create mapping system for strain-related terminology (strain names, effects, flavors, etc.)
   - Handle mixed content scenarios where some data is translated and some remains in original language
   - Implement caching mechanism for translated content to improve performance

4. **Strains Screen Specific Implementation:**
   - Translate strain categories, effects, and descriptive text
   - Implement real-time translation for user-generated content if applicable
   - Handle image alt-text and accessibility labels in German
   - Ensure proper text layout and UI adjustments for German text length differences

5. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Use translation hooks (useTranslation) throughout components
   - Implement lazy loading for translation files to optimize bundle size
   - Add fallback mechanisms for missing translations
   - Ensure proper text direction and layout adjustments for German text
   - Implement translation key validation and missing translation detection

# Test Strategy:
1. **Translation Completeness Testing:**
   - Audit entire app to ensure no hardcoded strings remain untranslated
   - Verify all UI elements display German text correctly on both iOS and Android
   - Test language switching functionality and persistence across app restarts
   - Validate that all error messages and notifications appear in German

2. **Strains Screen Translation Testing:**
   - Verify all API data in strains screen is properly translated before display
   - Test strain categories, effects, and descriptions show German translations
   - Confirm mixed content scenarios handle translation appropriately
   - Validate caching mechanism works correctly for translated strain data

3. **Functional Testing:**
   - Test app functionality remains intact after translation implementation
   - Verify forms, navigation, and user interactions work correctly in German
   - Test text input and search functionality with German characters and umlauts
   - Confirm date/time formatting displays correctly for German locale

4. **UI/UX Testing:**
   - Test text layout and spacing with longer German text strings
   - Verify UI components don't break or overflow with German translations
   - Test on various screen sizes and orientations on both platforms
   - Validate accessibility features work correctly with German content

5. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure app startup time with i18n implementation
   - Test translation loading performance and caching effectiveness
   - Verify memory usage remains acceptable with translation files loaded

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up i18n Infrastructure and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure react-i18next library, create language detection and switching mechanisms, and establish the foundation for internationalization throughout the app.
### Details:
Install react-i18next and i18next packages. Create i18n configuration file with language detection, fallback language settings, and resource loading. Set up translation file structure with en.json and de.json files using proper namespacing (common, navigation, forms, errors). Implement language context provider and create custom hooks for language switching. Configure interpolation settings and pluralization rules for German language. Set up async loading for translation resources.

## 2. Extract and Translate Static UI Content [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Extract all hardcoded strings from UI components and create comprehensive German translations for all static content including buttons, labels, headers, and form fields.
### Details:
Systematically go through all React Native components and extract hardcoded strings into translation keys using useTranslation hook. Create German translations for all UI elements including navigation items, button labels, form placeholders, headers, and static text. Implement proper German pluralization rules and handle gender-specific translations where applicable. Translate error messages, validation messages, and user feedback notifications. Set up date, time, and number formatting for German locale using i18next formatting plugins.
<info added on 2025-07-09T15:51:08.234Z>
Starting comprehensive translation analysis of AddPlantForm component. Found existing validation translation keys in use but missing from translation files. Also identified multiple hardcoded UI strings that need extraction and translation including form labels, button text, placeholders, and error messages that require immediate attention and addition to the German translation files.

## 3. Implement Dynamic Content Translation Service [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create translation middleware and services to handle API response translation, particularly for strain-related content that comes from backend services.
### Details:
Identify all API endpoints returning user-facing content for strains screen. Create translation service that intercepts API responses and translates dynamic content before passing to components. Implement mapping system for strain-related terminology including strain names, effects, flavors, and descriptions. Create translation cache mechanism to store translated content and improve performance. Handle mixed content scenarios where some data needs translation and some remains in original language. Set up error handling for translation service failures with fallback to original content.

COMPLETED: Successfully implemented comprehensive dynamic content translation system for German localization.

Major Achievements:

Core Translation Infrastructure Built:
- Created translation-service.ts (399 lines) - Core translation engine with intelligent caching
- Created translation-middleware.ts (367 lines) - API response interception and translation  
- Created useTranslation.ts hooks (168 lines) - React hooks for translation functionality
- Created translation-integration.ts (85 lines) - Service integration wrapper

- Effects: euphoric → euphorisch, relaxed → entspannt, happy → glücklich, etc. (10+ translations)
- Flavors: citrus → Zitrus, earthy → erdig, pine → Kiefer, etc. (10+ translations)  
- Grow difficulty: easy → einfach, medium → mittel, difficult → schwierig
- Enhanced de.json locale with comprehensive strain terminology
