            "details": "<info added on 2025-06-30T18:06:20.551Z>\nImplementation Plan (2025-06-30): Migrate strain-related forms to KeyboardAwareScrollView via FormKeyboardWrapper.\n\nTarget Components:\n1. components/strains/StrainFilterModal.tsx – vertical ScrollView with filters.\n2. (StrainSearch component does not itself scroll; no migration needed. However, StrainSearch usage inside screens/strains/StrainsView.tsx is wrapped by SafeAreaView/FlatList already handling keyboard dismissal. No changes required.)\n\nDetailed Steps for StrainFilterModal.tsx:\nA. Add import: `import FormKeyboardWrapper from '../ui/FormKeyboardWrapper';`.\nB. Replace vertical `<ScrollView contentContainerStyle={{ padding: 16 }}>` with `<FormKeyboardWrapper contentContainerStyle={{ padding: 16 }} showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}>`.\n   • Preserve padding and props (`contentContainerStyle`, `showsVerticalScrollIndicator=false`).\n   • Add `keyboardShouldPersistTaps=\"handled\"` implicitly provided by FormKeyboardWrapper.\nC. Keep horizontal ScrollViews for species selector – no change.\nD. Remove unused ScrollView import if only used for vertical part; keep for horizontal ones.\nE. Run `yarn lint` to ensure no unused imports and TypeScript passes.\nF. Manual QA: Open filter modal on iOS & Android simulators, focus any numeric input that might appear in future (currently none) – ensure content scrolls if keyboard overlaps slider area.\n\nRisks & Mitigations:\n• Modal currently full-screen; FormKeyboardWrapper must flex-grow to allow scrolling – underlying component sets flexGrow:1 via contentContainerStyle so OK.\n• No existing TextInput fields; future-proofing for potential numeric entry fields.\n\nNext Steps after implementation:\n• Smoke test and mark subtask 16.10 done.\n• Proceed to subtask 16.11 (BottomSheetKeyboardAwareScrollView wrapper).\n</info added on 2025-06-30T18:06:20.551Z>",

Automated Codebase Scan\n• Use a dedicated Node script `scripts/keyboard-hook-audit.ts` (will be executed with `tsx`) that:\n  1. Uses `fast-glob` to find all `*.ts`/`*.tsx` files.\n  2. Parses each file's AST with `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` to detect:\n      • `useEnhancedKeyboard` import or require\n      • Number of hook invocations per file\n      • Presence of advanced helpers (`setActiveInputIndex`, `dismissKeyboard`, `handleNext`, etc.)\n  3. Outputs JSON ➜ `docs/reports/keyboard-hook-usage.json` with shape:\n```ts\n{\n  filePath: string;\n  componentName: string;\n  totalInvocations: number;\n  advancedHelpers: boolean;\n  totalInputs: number | null  // if detectable via ref array length literal\n}\n```\n  4. Generates a human-readable CSV summary `docs/reports/keyboard-hook-usage.csv` for quick review.\n\n#### 2. Categorisation Logic\n• **Simple**  ➡️ `advancedHelpers === false` **AND** `totalInvocations === 1` **AND** input count ≤ 2\n• **Complex** ➡️ anything else\n\n#### 3. Manual Review Pass\nAfter the script runs, open the CSV and manually verify edge cases (e.g. shared wrapper components).\n\n#### 4. Migration-Priority Matrix (to be added to `docs/reports/keyboard-migration-matrix.csv`)\n| Component / Screen | File Path | Complexity | Est.

Next Steps\n1. Implement the audit script and commit both JSON & CSV outputs.\n2. Validate categorisation accuracy – update matrix as needed.\n3. Present final matrix to core team for approval before starting migrations (Subtask 17.2 ➜ implementation of lightweight hook).\n\n#### 6. Risks & Mitigations\n• **False positives in AST analysis** – manual review step included.\n• **Large report size** – store under `docs/reports/` to keep repo tidy.\n• **Performance measurement overhead** – will use React DevTools & Chrome Profiler only on release builds to minimise noise.\n\n---\n*Logged by AI assistant after initial exploration.

            "details": "### Objective\nFix build-blocking import errors introduced during the keyboard migration by updating every remaining module that:\n1. Still references `FormKeyboardWrapper`, `BottomSheetKeyboardWrapper`, or deprecated keyboard hooks where the replacement is now **EnhancedKeyboardWrapper** or **useKeyboardPadding**.\n2. Uses broken/relative paths to the new components (e.g. `../../../../components/keyboard/EnhancedKeyboardWrapper`) instead of the agreed alias `@/components/keyboard/EnhancedKeyboardWrapper`.\n3. Mixes default vs named imports causing metro bundler resolution failures.\n\n### Scope of Work\n- Scan the entire repo for these strings and update:\n  • `FormKeyboardWrapper` → `EnhancedKeyboardWrapper` (update usage & props where API differs)\n  • `../keyboard/FormKeyboardWrapper`, `../keyboard/BottomSheetKeyboardWrapper` → correct paths or replacements\n  • Wrong named import `{ EnhancedKeyboardWrapper }` vs default import\n  • Hook imports: `useKeyboardbasic`, `useKeyboardHeight` → `useKeyboardPadding` (and refactor usages)\n- Update affected components (approx. 10-12 files: AddPlantForm, DiaryEntryForm, EditPlantForm(UI), StrainFilterModal, CommentModal, profile edit screen, plant edit/diary screens, etc.).\n- Remove any now-unused legacy imports.\n- Run `yarn lint --fix` to auto-organize imports; ensure ESLint no-deprecated rule passes.\n\n### Deliverables\n1. Clean commit replacing all incorrect imports.\n2. Passing TypeScript build (`expo start --clear` succeeds).\n3. Manual smoke test: open Add/Edit plant, Comment modal, DiaryEntry, StrainFilterModal, Profile edit, Plant diary—to verify keyboard still works.\n4. Update legacy removal checklist in task **18.7** marking import migration complete.\n\n### Notes\n- Keep **BottomSheetKeyboardWrapper** where bottom-sheet specific behavior is still required (CreatePostBottomSheet).\n- Use alias `@/components/keyboard/EnhancedKeyboardWrapper` wherever possible.\n- Ensure **EnhancedKeyboardWrapper** retains props: `className`, `extraOffset`, `showToolbar`, etc.\n\n<info added on 2025-07-01T09:32:34.055Z>\n### Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Import Migration\n\n**Confirmed Files Requiring FormKeyboardWrapper Migration:**\n- components/strains/StrainFilterModal.tsx (3 usages)\n- components/my-plants/EditPlantForm.tsx (3 usages)\n- components/community/CommentModal.tsx (3 usages + AnimatedFormKeyboardWrapper alias)\n- components/diary/DiaryEntryForm.tsx (4 usages including Animated wrapper)\n- components/AddPlantForm.tsx (2 usages)\n- app/(app)/profile/edit/[id].tsx (3 usages)\n- app/(app)/plant/[id]/edit.tsx (2 usages)\n\n**Files with Incorrect EnhancedKeyboardWrapper Paths:**\n- components/community/CreatePostScreen.tsx (needs alias path update)\n- app/(app)/plant/diary/[id].tsx (needs alias path update)\n\n**Migration Steps:**\n1. **Import Line Updates:**\n   - Replace `import FormKeyboardWrapper from '../keyboard/FormKeyboardWrapper'` with `import EnhancedKeyboardWrapper from '@/components/keyboard/EnhancedKeyboardWrapper'`\n   - Handle all relative path variants (`../../../../components/...`)\n\n2. **JSX Tag Replacements:**\n   - `<FormKeyboardWrapper>` → `<EnhancedKeyboardWrapper>`\n   - Update Animated.createAnimatedComponent(FormKeyboardWrapper) to use EnhancedKeyboardWrapper as base\n\n3. **Props Mapping:**\n   - `bottomOffset` → `extraOffset`\n   - Remove deprecated props: `useKeyboardHook`, `complexity`, `keyboardOffset`\n   - Preserve: `className`, `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`, other ScrollView props\n\n4. **Validation Commands:**\n   ```\n   yarn lint --fix\n   expo start --clear & yarn tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit\n   ```\n\n5. **Manual Test Checklist:**\n   - Add Plant form keyboard behavior\n   - Edit Plant form keyboard behavior\n   - Diary Entry form (animated wrapper) keyboard behavior\n   - Comment modal keyboard behavior\n   - Profile edit screen keyboard behavior\n   - StrainFilterModal keyboard behavior\n\n**Next Action:** Execute code refactor following steps 1-3 above.\n</info added on 2025-07-01T09:32:34.055Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-01T09:38:28.344Z>\n### Progress Update - 2025-07-01\n\n**Completed Migrations (40% Complete):**\n✅ components/strains/StrainFilterModal.tsx - wrapper replaced & props updated, compile-safe\n✅ components/my-plants/EditPlantForm.tsx - wrapper replaced & props updated, compile-safe  \n✅ components/community/CommentModal.tsx - wrapper replaced & props updated, compile-safe\n\n**In Progress:**\n◐ components/diary/DiaryEntryForm.tsx - import & animated wrapper swapped but requires cleanup:\n  - Invalid ref prop on AnimatedEnhancedKeyboardWrapper\n  - Extraneous contentContainerStyle & paddingBottom props mis-placed\n  - Dangling reference to old AnimatedFormKeyboardWrapper symbol\n  - Next: refactor to remove unsupported props, wrap inner content in <View>, ensure typings pass\n\n**Remaining File Migrations:**\n🔜 components/AddPlantForm.tsx (2 usages)\n🔜 app/(app)/profile/edit/[id].tsx (3 usages)  \n🔜 app/(app)/plant/[id]/edit.tsx (2 usages)\n\n**Path Alias Corrections Needed:**\n🔜 components/community/CreatePostScreen.tsx → use '@/components/keyboard/EnhancedKeyboardWrapper'\n🔜 app/(app)/plant/diary/[id].tsx → same alias update\n\n**Next Actions:**\n1.
