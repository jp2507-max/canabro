# Task ID: 4
# Title: Apply Database Security and Schema Audit Recommendations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement security and schema changes based on audit findings, including enabling RLS on deleted tables, renaming columns, adding generated columns, tightening storage ACLs, dropping redundant indexes, and setting compliant defaults.
# Details:
1. Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables that track deleted records to ensure only authorized users can access or restore deleted data. 
2. Rename the 'plants.stage' column to the recommended name from the audit, updating all references in queries, models, and documentation.
3. Add a 'post_id' generated column to relevant tables, ensuring it is correctly populated and indexed for efficient lookups.
4. Review and tighten access control lists (ACLs) on all storage buckets, restricting access to only necessary roles and enforcing least privilege.
5. Identify and drop redundant indexes as flagged in the audit to improve performance and reduce maintenance overhead.
6. Add or update default values for columns as specified by CanaBro business rules, ensuring data integrity and compliance.
7. Coordinate with development and DevOps teams to ensure all changes are applied in both development and production environments, with proper migration scripts and rollback plans.
8. Document all changes and communicate updates to affected teams.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify RLS is enabled and enforced on all relevant tables by attempting access with various user roles.
- Confirm the 'plants.stage' column is renamed everywhere and that no references to the old name remain.
- Check that the 'post_id' generated column is present, correctly populated, and indexed.
- Audit storage bucket ACLs to ensure only authorized roles have access, and attempt unauthorized access to confirm restrictions.
- Run database performance and integrity tests to ensure redundant indexes are removed and no queries are negatively impacted.
- Validate that all columns have correct default values and that new records adhere to CanaBro business rules.
- Review migration logs and perform rollback tests to ensure safe deployment.
- Solicit feedback from affected teams to confirm no disruptions to workflows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enable Row-Level Security (RLS) on Deleted Tables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement RLS on all tables that track deleted records to restrict access and restoration capabilities to authorized users only.
### Details:
Review audit findings to identify relevant tables, configure RLS policies, and test access restrictions for compliance.

## 2. Rename 'plants.stage' Column and Update References [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Rename the 'plants.stage' column to the audit-recommended name and update all references in queries, models, and documentation.
### Details:
Coordinate with development teams to identify all code and documentation referencing 'plants.stage', perform the rename, and validate updates.

## 3. Add and Index 'post_id' Generated Column [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a generated 'post_id' column to specified tables, ensuring correct population and indexing for efficient lookups.
### Details:
Define the generation logic, update table schemas, and create necessary indexes as per audit recommendations.

## 4. Tighten Storage Bucket Access Control Lists (ACLs) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and restrict storage bucket ACLs to enforce least privilege, allowing access only to necessary roles.
### Details:
Audit current ACLs, update permissions to remove unnecessary access, and document changes for compliance.

### Details:
Review business rules and audit findings, update schema defaults, and validate data consistency.

## 7. Coordinate, Migrate, and Document All Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Work with development and DevOps teams to apply changes in all environments, ensure proper migration scripts and rollback plans, and document updates for affected teams.
