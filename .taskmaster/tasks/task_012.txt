# Title: Implement TanStack Query v5 State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Setup TanStack Query for server state management with caching, optimistic updates, and error handling
# Details:
Install @tanstack/react-query@^5.0.0 and setup QueryClient with proper cache configuration. Create custom hooks for all API operations (plants, strains, posts, comments). Implement optimistic updates for better UX. Setup error boundaries and retry logic. Configure background refetching and stale-while-revalidate patterns. Implement infinite queries for paginated data. Setup query invalidation strategies for data consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test query caching and invalidation. Verify optimistic updates rollback on errors. Test offline behavior and background sync.
